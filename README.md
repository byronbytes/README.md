# Byron

ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Byron! My main career is programming and working with code. I code in C# and I use Visual Studio as my IDE.

## About Me
I always had an interest with coding and technology ever since a young age. I started using a computer since I was 2 years old and I started creating scripts and programs at the age of 9 using VBS and Batch. When I was 10-11 years old I started to learn VB.NET and c#. I started a business called LiteTools, which you can visit at https://litetools.net
