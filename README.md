# Byron

ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Byron! My main career is programming and working with code. I code in C# and I use Visual Studio as my IDE.

## About Me
The start of my programming career is something that I will never forget, and itâ€™s something that has shaped me and my career into who I am today and who I will be in the future. I had been working with technology ever since I was 9. It started off with simple and small VBS and Batch scripts that I watched tutorials on. This had progressed into me self-learning C# and starting off a successful programming career at the age of 13.


	In 2018, I wanted to make a chatting application, I vaguely remember having paperwork on what the menus would look like, and what would happen. Before all of the magic started, I had tried making this as a mobile application. The unfortunate decision I made was with this free application creator thing, for reasons, I will not be naming it. The website said that you could make FREE applications, which was really good for me. This was going well up until the 3rd day where everything stopped working and it was broken. I had to contact support multiple times to figure out that they LOCKED my application, and I needed to pay for it. Another thing is that they had peculiar staff who didnâ€™t answer my questions, more of just asked real life questions. I had to come up with a fake persona since I was 10 at the time, but still, the staff shouldâ€™ve helped instead of asking questions about my imaginary children.



	Around 2019, I found out about Visual Studio and really liked it, which is what led me to installing it and looking up tutorials on how to use it. The first application I ever developed was called Contacts+, a contacts application that didnâ€™t work. Later, I tried making something called Cloudium, which was an all in one essential application created in VB.NET, it wasnâ€™t a helpful language to learn, but if I never learned it, I would be somewhere else. This is because I needed help learning the language and joined a Discord support server about it, and I have been in that community ever since, they have other channels, so I can ask C# questions there too. This project stuck with me until early 2020, where I dropped the idea of an essentials application. Some features have migrated to other projects I made such as the Settings style, theme changing, and more. 



	Fast forward to Pre-Covid 2020, there was a Technology project where you can do basically anything. Since it was tech class, I decided to make an application for it. It was called ProPanel and it was meant to be a lightweight and simple application that has small tasks such as running applications, wifi options, and computer options too. Needless to say I got a 100 in that class. Later, after the project, I decided this was a great idea to improvise on and so I worked on it for a long time, until I realized that I worked on it so much, it lost its meaning and I cancelled the project.



	Now, weâ€™re on summer vacation of 2021. I decided to start a little project that worked as a lightweight computer optimizer, it was named Tasks. This project gained a little bit of traction and I decided to move it to a company, which I named LiteTools. After I updated and moved it to LiteTools, it gained a huge amount of popularity and as of today it has 2.7k downloads in total. This also helped me create other projects under the name LiteTools and all of those projects helped build up on possibly innovative ideas.
