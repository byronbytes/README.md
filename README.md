ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Matty, a programmer who wants to make the world a better place. I'm focused on programming in C# and Java, and I also created LiteTools which is a business that aims to make apps that enhance productivity and efficiency. I've always had an interest with computers since a very young age and started to do programming in 2017.

#### Experiences
I am mainly experienced in C# and WinForms and I'm also going to be learning Java.
